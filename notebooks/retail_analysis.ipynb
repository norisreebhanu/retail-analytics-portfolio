# Retail Sales & Inventory Performance Analysis
This notebook analyzes retail sales data to calculate core business KPIs and evaluate SKU performance.
The analysis complements the SQL-based KPI calculations in this repository and demonstrates Python-based data analysis and storytelling.

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
df = pd.read_csv("../data/raw/sample_superstore.csv")
df.head()
df.info()
df.isna().sum()
total_revenue = df["Sales"].sum()
total_profit = df["Profit"].sum()
total_units = df["Quantity"].sum()
total_orders = df["Order ID"].nunique()

pd.DataFrame({
    "Metric": ["Revenue", "Profit", "Units Sold", "Orders"],
    "Value": [total_revenue, total_profit, total_units, total_orders]
})
(
    df.groupby("Product Name")[["Sales", "Profit"]]
      .sum()
      .sort_values("Sales", ascending=False)
      .head(10)
)
## Key Insights

- A small subset of products drives a significant portion of total revenue.
- Some high-revenue SKUs have relatively low profit, indicating potential margin optimization opportunities.
- These insights can inform pricing, promotions, or inventory decisions.
